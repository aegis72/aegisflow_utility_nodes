# aegisflow_utility_nodes
The Utility nodes have a variety of "Passer" nodes that can both passs through items targeted by Use Everywhere nodes, as well as secure an input that requires one. This is necessary because Comfy will try to "fix" those inputs using any output that matches, even if that doesn't work, breaking the wf (this is an "all workflows problem, not an AegisFlow problem.

Most commonly used is an "image" passer, but you can do others like latenst, etc.

There is also the "multipasser" which gangs them all together so they can be collapsed into the "superlaser."



Ally's Nodes, with an extension.
I was having many users unable to satisfy some great nodes from the ally and thusly integrated them here, and extended them with an "enable/disable" switch.
